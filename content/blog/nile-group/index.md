Abdo wanted to create a professional email, for his B2B business when he contacted me. He also wanted to make a site to display the companyâ€™s he has been dealing with, and he wanted it kind of soon. Since this was when I was still inexperienced I made it for him using wordpress. When I had absolutely no idea what it was, but I was confident I could learn it and still deliver it on time.
The hardest part was the time window I had to deliver the project on, He wanted it in one month, so I had to learn, make the content, organize it and display it on the made website. I was provided with the pictures of the trucks and stocks he had.
This gave me a lot of experience with using wordpress, templating, and a private domain using bluehost.
