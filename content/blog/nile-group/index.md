Nile Group is a distribution and trading agency. They wanted to create a professional email and website for their B2B business when they contacted me. The website needed to display the companies theyâ€™ve been working with, and they needed this website really soon. Since this was when I was still inexperienced, I made it using Wordpress. I had absolutely no idea how to use Wordpress at the time, but I was confident I could learn it and still deliver it on time.

The hardest part was the time window I had to deliver the project on, a month. I had to learn Wordpress, create content, organize it and display it on the website within a month. This gave me a lot of experience with using wordpress, templates, and a private domain using Bluehost.
