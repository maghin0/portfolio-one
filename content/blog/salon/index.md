Mona wished to make an app that could match people together so they could get married! Kind of like tinder right? Well no, the culture in Egypt is much different. Let’s put it that way it’s more like family arranged marriages. They look at each other’s degrees and assets and then they meet, if they see that the person is a good match for them personality wise. They could get married then. While this seems very strange to us, it was the case for this website, I was able to empathize and design a culture friendly (as any revealing pictures or “sexual” content as well as other things could drive many away) website that would let them fill out forms and submit it to a well-known source.

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
